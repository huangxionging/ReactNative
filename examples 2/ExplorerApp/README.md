# Run the example project

```
git clone https://github.com/akveo/react-native-ui-kitten.git
cd react-native-ui-kitten/examples/explorerApp
yarn
npm start (or 'npm run ios' / 'npm run android')

The application references to the local version of react-native-ui-kitten.
If you have to try some your changes made in the library you can use 'update-lib' script to update the package.
Or you can use faster 'copy-lib' if your changes are not related to packages structure.
```

You can also try it with the Expo app at https://expo.io/@akveo/ui-kitten-explorer-app
